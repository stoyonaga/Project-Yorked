# Introduction 

Project Yorked is a website that aims to help first year Lassonde School of Engineering students successfully transition into the 
University setting. 

It contains answers to frequently asked questions, in addition to many resources that students may be unaware of.

Lastly, it contains a brief description of each course and what you will learn from the Computer Science Core Prerequisites Curriculum.

**"It's not like as if there's something you can do about. It's not like as if it's not going to happen. It's just a question of when...**"

The site is currently hosted and accessible at [https://stoyonaga.github.io/Project-Yorked/](https://stoyonaga.github.io/Project-Yorked/).
